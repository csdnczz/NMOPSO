This is the source code for the algorithm **Navigation Variable-based 
Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (NMOPSO) algorithm**. 
The current implementation is for path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). 
However, it can be modified to apply to other optimization problems. 
This algorithm is detailed in the paper:"T.N. Duong, D.-N. Bui, M.D. Phung. Navigation Variable-based Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization for UAV Path Planning with Kinematic Constraints"

Please cite the paper if you use this code.

To run the program, download all the source files and run "NMOPSOmain.m" in MATLAB.
